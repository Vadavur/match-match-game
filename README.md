This project is a component based single page application game.
The goal of the match-match game is to remember all the cards' positions for the short period while they are exposed and then, after cards are turned over, correctly click on paired cards successively.

* Basic structure:

There are always visible header with control panel on it and three views on the site: "About me", "Best Score" and "Game Settings".

"About me" view contains short game instructions.

"Best Score" view contains 10 best scores.

"Game Settings" view contains two settings:
- game difficulty (which determines the field size)
- cards types (which determines the pictures)

Control panel contains a "REGISTER NEW PLAYER" button and after registration it contains "START GAME" button, "EXIT" button and player avatar or default image if player didn't load any.

A popup window appears after clicking on a registration button, where user can put his data and load an avatar. A game starts after clicking on the "START GAME" button.
